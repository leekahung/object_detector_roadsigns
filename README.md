# Object Detector for Roadsigns
 A computer vision project. This is a repository for an AI-powered object detector for roadsigns. 
(Full documentation will be written soon)

# 1. Data
 (More coming soon. For now, see README.md file under workspace/object_detector/ for details.)

# 2. Model
 (More coming soon. Overall, our model uses transfer learning where a pre-trained model (SSD ResNet50  
V1) was used to train our very own custom object detection model.)

 * [ResNet50 Model](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/retinanet/resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640/1)

# 3. Data Cleaning
 (Coming soon.)

# 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 (Coming soon.)

# 5. Data Preprocessing and Modeling
 (More coming soon. Model was trained for 25000 steps (2000 of which were warm-up steps).)

# 6. Conclusion and Future Improvements
 (Coming soon.)
